# Dataset Specific Scripts

As some of the datasets used in this work were predominantly aimed at a more traditional classification procedure, we required a few additional dataset specific scripts for correctly formatting the sets into somthing that is consistent for sampling. These scripts are included here, specifically they include:
  -  folder_sort_ESC.py (folder creation and sorting script for ESC-50, which in its original form is just a folder with audio files and some meta-data csv) 
  -  folder_sort_NSYNTH.py (folder creation and sorting script for NSynth, similar in principle to the ESC-50 one above)
  -  folder_sort_KAGGLE18.py (folder sorting etc for Kaggle18 set)
  -  pruning_BirdClef.py (A file for the sample/class pruning of the BirdClef2020 dataset)
