## Meta-Aware Splits

For both of our fixed length datasets (ESC-50 & NSynth) we define some meta-data aware stratified splits, motivated by the goal of allowing for more complex and specific problem statemenets. For both of these sets we look at using major class groupings in order to do this, were for each major grouping we share the classes belonging to equally (by weight, i.e 70% for training) between train/val/test.
