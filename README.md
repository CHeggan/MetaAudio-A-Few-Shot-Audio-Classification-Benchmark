# MetaAudio-A-Few-Shot-Audio-Classification-Benchmark
A new comprehensive and diverse few-shot acoustic classification benchmark. This work covers the following:
 - Standardised datasets splits and reproducible results from which to benchmark against
 - Variety of algorithms designed to deal with few-shot classification, ranging from 'cheap' traditional training pielines to SOTA Gradient-Based Meta-Learning (GBML) models
 - Both Fixed and Variable length datasets form a variety of acoustic settings
